# Divide and Conquer

## General

- Steps
  - Divide into smaller subproblems
  - Conquer via recursive recalls
  - Combine solutions of subproblems
  
- The Problem
  - Input: Array A containing the numbers [1, 2, 3, ..., n] in some arbitrary order
  - Output: Number of inversions (i.e. number of pairs (i, j) iwth i < j and A[i] > A[j]
  - e.g. [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]
    - Inversions: [3, 2], [5, 2], [5, 4]
  - Utility: Collaborative filtering (e.g. amazon suggesting what to buy based on similar buying patterns from other people).
