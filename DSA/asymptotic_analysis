# Asymptotic Analysis

## General

- Motivation
  - Asymptotic analysis provides vocabulary for discussing design and analysis of algorithms.
    - Hits the "sweet spot" for high-level reasoning about algorithms
    - Coarse enough to suppress architecture/language/compiler-dependent details
    - Sharp enough to make useful comparisons between different algorithms
    
- Big-O Notation
  - Definition:  T(n) = O(f(n)) if and only if there exist constants c, n0 > 0 such that T(n) <= c * f(n) for all n >= n0.
    - Translation: O(f(n)) describes any pattern f(n) for any constant c greater than zero.
    - e.g. 2f(n) and 3f(n) can both be described by O(f(n)).
    
- Omega Notation
  - Definition:  T(n) = Omega(f(n)) if and only if there exist constants c, n0 such that T(n) >= c * f(n) for all n >= n0.
    - Translation:  Omega(n) is the lower bound of f(n) because it grows more slowly.
  
- Theta Notation
  - Definition:  T(n) = t(f(n)) if and only if T(n) = O(f(n) and T(n) = Omega(f(n)).
  
- Little-O Notation
  - Definition:  T(n) = o(f(n)) if and only if for all constants c > 0, there is a constant n0 such that T(n) <= c * f(n) for all n>= n0.
