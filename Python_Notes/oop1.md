# Object Oriented Programming I

## Objectives

- Define Object Oriented Programming
- Understand encapsulation and abstraction
- Create classes and instances and attach methods and properties to each

---

## General

- Objected Oriented Programming
  - Definition:  A programming paradigm which attempts to model some process or thing as a **class** or **object/instance**.
  - **class**:  A blueprint for objects.  Classes can contain methods (functions) and attributes.
    - Defines everything needed for creating an object.
    - e.g.  A user class has attributes (e.g. profile picture, username, password, e-mail).
    - e.g.  A user class has methods (e.g. change profile picture, log-out, check-out).
  - **object/instance**:  Objects that are constructed from a **class** blueprint which contains the class methods and properties.
  - Uses
    - OOP is an approach for *encapsulating* code into logical, hierarchical groupings using classes.
    - Allows for using logic at higher levels.
    
- **Abstraction**
  - Definition:
