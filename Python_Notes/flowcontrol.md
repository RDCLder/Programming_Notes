# Flow Control

## Conditional Logic

- Boolean Logic
  - Everything is expressed as either True or False (1 or 0)
  - Truthiness is the measure of whether something is True

- Statements in Python are evaluated using Boolean logic
  - Statements are either True or False
  - Statements include anything that evaluates a condition
    - AND statements require both components be True
    - OR statements require either components to be true
    - e.g. 1 AND 0 would be False while 1 OR 0 would be True

## Loops

- If/elif/else
  - ```if-if-if``` loops tests all conditions.
  - ```if-elif``` loops tests conditions until one is true.
    - Used when conditions are mutually exclusive.

- For

- While
