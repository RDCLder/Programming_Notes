WINDOWS Command Line Fundamentals

•	The PowerShell is the command prompt for windows OS
o	An OS is structured like a tree in which a root directory can then branch off into subdirectories (e.g. folders, files, etc.)
	Root directory is C:
	Levels of the hierarchy are separated by \
	Home directory is designated by ~ and is usually C:\Users\Username

o	The command prompt has greater functionality than a GUI like Windows Explorer
	e.g.  Instead of manually dragging a file from directory to directory, PowerShell can perform that function with a line of code

•	PowerShell has several basic functions that can be used to manipulate files
o	Basic directory functions
	cd	addresses the current directory
	..	goes back one level to parent directory (e.g. cd ..)
	ls	lists all the contents of current directory
	wpd	lists the exact path from root directory to current directory
	~	accesses the home directory

o	Other functions
	clear	clears current PowerShell text

•	Creating Directories
o	mkdir command can make new directories
	syntax:  mkdir folder
	This will create a new folder called “folder” in the current directory

•	Creating Files
